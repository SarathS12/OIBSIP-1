               <strong>Albert Einstein</strong>(14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.

                His works were recognized across the world and in 1921, Einstein won the prestigious Nobel Prize for Physics for his significant work on the photoelectric effect. Let us dig into Albert Einstein’s inventions.

                Some inventions and contributions of Einstein are Avogadro’s Number, Quantum Theory of Light, General Theory of Relativity, Special Theory of Relativity, The Photoelectric Effect, Wave-Particle Duality, Brownian movement, the relationship between mass and energy, Bose-Einstein Condensate, and many more.

            <h3>Some Interesting Facts About Albert Einstein</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Einstein was a hard-headed child. When he was born, seeing the shape of the back of his head, his mother and family believed it was a malformation.
              </li>
              <li>
                A compass sparked his interest in science.
When Einstein was 5 years old and sick in bed, his father gave him a compass and the little boy was fascinated that the needle always pointed to the same place. This made him understand that there were forces that drove things where there was apparently nothing.
              </li>
              <li>
                He was a talented violinist. One of the most unknown aspects of the physicist’s personal life was his fondness for the violin. At the age of 6 he began to take classes, he himself said that if he had not been a scientist he would have dedicated himself to music.
              </li>
              <li>
                He could have been Israel’s second president. After the death of Israel’s first president in 1952, Chaim Weizmann, the physicist was a direct candidate to take his place because he was considered “the best living Jew.” However, he immediately rejected the offer arguing that because of his age he did not feel able to assume such responsibility.
              </li>
              <li>
                Einstein, throughout his life, had a mild form of echolalia, which caused him to repeat phrases to himself, two or three times, especially if he liked them. He liked to think in pictures, an important tactic of some of the world’s most renowned thinkers and scientists including Nikola Tesla.
              </li>
              <li>
                Galileo Galilei was Einstein’s favorite scientist.
              </li>
              <li>
                Einstein was born German and a Jew. Einstein renounced his German citizenship in 1896. He became a Swiss citizen in 1901. However, he died in 1955 as an American citizen.
              </li>
              <li>
                When Einstein received his doctorate, he was promoted from a third class to a second class technical expert at the patent office and his salary was raised to 4,500 Francs a year.
              </li>
              <li>
                Einstein became one of the most famous faces on the planet when his prediction that gravity bends light was confirmed during an eclipse in 1919.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Royal Society of London awarded him its prestigious Copely Medal in 1925 for his theory of relativity and contributions to quantum theory.
